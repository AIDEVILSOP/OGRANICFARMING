        <b>
        <dl><ol class="list1">
            <dt class="style2"><li><i>Sustainability over the long term</i></li></dt>
            <dd class="style1 font7"> Many changes observed in the environment are long term, occurring slowly over time. Organic agriculture considers the medium- and long-term effect of agricultural interventions on the agro-ecosystem. It aims to produce food while establishing an ecological balance to prevent soil fertility or pest problems</dd><br>
            <dt class="style2"><li><i>Soil</i></li></dt>
            <dd class="style1 font7">Soil building practices such as crop rotations, inter-cropping, symbiotic associations, cover crops, organic fertilizers and minimum tillage are central to organic practices. These encourage soil fauna and flora, improving soil formation and structure and creating more stable systems. 
In turn, nutrient and energy cycling is increased and the retentive abilities of the soil for nutrients and water are enhanced, compensating for the non-use of mineral fertilizers. Such management techniques also play an important role in soil erosion control.</dd><br>
            <dt class="style2"><li><i>Water</i></li></dt>
            <dd class="style1 font7">In many agriculture areas, pollution of groundwater courses with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is a major problem. 
As the use of these is prohibited in organic agriculture, they are replaced by organic fertilizers (e.g. compost, animal manure, green manure) and through the use of greater biodiversity (in terms of species cultivated and permanent vegetation), enhancing soil structure and water infiltration</dd><br>
            <dt class="style2"><li><i>Air and Climate Change</i></li></dt>
            <dd class="style1 font7">Organic agriculture reduces non-renewable energy use by decreasing agrochemical needs (these require high quantities of fossil fuel to be produced). Organic agriculture contributes to mitigating the greenhouse effect and global warming through its ability to sequester carbon in the soil.</dd><br>
            <dt class="style2"><li><i>Biodiversity</i></li></dt>
            <dd class="style1 font7">Organic farmers are both custodians and users of biodiversity at all levels. At the gene level, traditional and adapted seeds and breeds are preferred for their greater resistance to diseases and their resilience to climatic stress. At the species level, diverse combinations of plants and animals optimize nutrient and energy cycling for agricultural production</dd><br>
            <dt class="style2"><li><i>Gentically Modified Organisms</i></li></dt>
            <dd class="style1 font7">The use of GMOs within organic systems is not permitted during any stage of organic food production, processing or handling.
 As the potential impact of GMOs to both the environment and health is not entirely understood, organic agriculture is taking the precautionary approach and choosing to encourage natural biodiversity. The organic label therefore provides an assurance that GMOs have not been used intentionally in the production and processing of the organic products.</dd><br>
            <dt class="style2"><li><i>Ecological Servics</i></li></dt>
            <dd class="style1 font7">The impact of organic agriculture on natural resources favours interactions within the agro-ecosystem that are vital for both agricultural production and nature conservation. Ecological services derived include soil forming and conditioning, soil stabilization, waste recycling, carbon sequestration, nutrients cycling, predation, pollination and habitats</dd><br>
